# edit-reader-tags

Bulk edit tags in readwise reader.

⚠️ Looks like the [Reader API](https://readwise.io/reader_api) doesn't support this yet. "Document CREATE" is currently the only endpoint. I'll have to come back to this code when the API has a tags endpoint...😕

## usage

1. create a `keys.json` file (see `keys.example.json`)
